# my [neptune](https://github.com/uwu/neptune) plugins
This is a repository containing every plugin I have made for the [neptune](https://github.com/uwu/neptune) client mods.

## Experiments
Experiments allows you to toggle experimental TIDAL features.

Copy the following URL to the neptune plugin install page to install Experiments: `https://twnlink.github.io/neptune-plugins/Experiments`

## Desktop Connect
Allows you to use your phone as a remote control for the TIDAL Desktop client via TIDAL Connect by forcibly enabling the internal TIDAL Connect desktop mode. (Only works on Android I think? But you can always test for yourself :D)

NOTE: Desktop Connect is buggy! It takes advantage of an internal TIDAL feature not meant for use by the general public.
If you know what you're doing, PR a fix, if you don't, don't bother me about it!
